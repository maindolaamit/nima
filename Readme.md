# Image Quality Assessment

Project to implement Neural Image Quality Assessment using Deep Learning CNN based on Google's research papaer "NIMA :
Neural Image Assessment"

NIMA consists of two models that aim to predict the aesthetic and technical quality of images, respectively. The models
are trained via transfer learning, where ImageNet pre-trained CNNs are used and fine-tuned for the classification task.

The provided code allows the use any of pre-trained models in Keras. The models trained on AVA images for local CPU.
